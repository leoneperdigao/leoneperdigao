# Hi, I'm Leone 👋

**AI Architect & Engineer** — I help companies get AI right, from strategy through implementation.

I work across both altitudes: I advise CTOs on AI direction, then help their teams build it. I create enterprise AI architectures, then review the PRs that implement them. That's the rare combination — principal-level thinking with hands-on delivery.

## What I'm Working On

- **Enterprise AI Architecture** — designing AI systems at scale (Generative AI, Agentic AI, MLOps)
- **LLM/Agent Systems** — tool-using agents, planning/memory architectures, evaluation & safety
- **Production AI** — from research prototypes to shipped products that actually work

Building in **Python**, **TypeScript**, **Go**, and **Java**.

## Background

- 12+ years in software engineering, 5+ specializing in AI/ML
- MSc in Artificial Intelligence (University of Bath, with Distinction)
- Previously: IBM (Advisory AI Engineer across 15+ countries), PostNL (AI architecture with CTO)
